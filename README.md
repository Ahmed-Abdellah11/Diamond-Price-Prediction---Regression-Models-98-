# Diamond-Price-Prediction-Regression-Models(98)

## About the Data
**This classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. There are 10 attributes included in the dataset including the target ie. price.**

* **carat (0.2-5.01): The carat is the diamond’s physical weight measured in metric carats. One carat equals 0.20 grams and is subdivided into 100 points.**

* **Cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal): The quality of the cut. The more precise the diamond is cut, the more captivating the diamond is to the eye thus of high grade.**

* **color (from J (worst) to D (best)): The color of gem-quality diamonds occurs in many hues. In the range from colorless to light yellow or light brown. Colourless diamonds are the rarest. Other natural colors (blue, red, pink for example) are known as "fancy,” and their color grading is different than from white colorless diamonds.**

* **clarity (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best)): Diamonds can have internal characteristics known as inclusions or external characteristics known as blemishes. Diamonds without inclusions or blemishes are rare; however, most characteristics can only be seen with magnification.**

* **depth (43-79): It is the total depth percentage which equals z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y). The depth of the diamond is its height (in millimeters) measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (flat, top surface) as referred to in the labeled diagram above.**

* **Table (43-95): It is the width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point. It gives diamond stunning fire and brilliance by reflecting lights in all directions which when seen by an observer, seems lustrous.**

* **Price ($$326 - $18826): It is the price of the diamond in US dollars. It is our very target column in the dataset.**

* **x (0 - 10.74): Length of the diamond (in mm)**

* **y (0 - 58.9): Width of the diamond (in mm)**

* **z (0 - 31.8): Depth of the diamond (in mm)**
